# dynamo.connect.ReadableOperation

An operation which enables a remote worker to read data from the local worker.

To create the operation, a set of local [`Descriptor`](descriptor.md) objects must be provided that reference memory intended to be transferred to a remote worker.
Once created, the memory referenced by the provided descriptors becomes immediately readable by a remote worker with the necessary metadata.
The RDMA metadata ([RdmaMetadata](rdma_metadata.md)) required to access the memory referenced by the provided descriptors is accessible via the operations `.metadata()` method.
Once acquired, the metadata needs to be provided to a remote worker via a secondary channel, most likely HTTP or TCP+NATS.

Disposal of the object will instruct the RDMA subsystem to cancel the operation,
therefore the operation should be awaited until completed unless cancellation is intended.


## Example Usage

```python
    async def send_data(
      self,
      local_tensor: torch.Tensor
    ) -> None:
      descriptor = dynamo.connect.Descriptor(local_tensor)

      with self.connector.create_readable(descriptor) as read_op:
        op_metadata = read_op.metadata()

        # Send the metadata to the remote worker via sideband communication.
        await self.notify_remote_data(op_metadata)
        # Wait for the remote worker to complete its read operation of local_tensor.
        # AKA send data to remote worker.
        await read_op.wait_for_completion()
```


## Methods

### `metadata`

Generates and returns the RDMA metadata ([RdmaMetadata](rdma_metadata.md)) required for a remote worker to read from the operation.
Once acquired, the metadata needs to be provided to a remote worker via a secondary channel, most likely HTTP or TCP+NATS.

### `status`

Returns [`OperationStatus`](operation_status.md) which provides the current state (aka. status) of the operation.

### `wait_for_completion`

Blocks the caller until the operation has received a completion signal from a remote worker.
