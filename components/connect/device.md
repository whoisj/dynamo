# dynamo.connect.Device

`Device` class describes the device a given allocation resides in.
Usually host (`"cpu"`) or GPU (`"cuda"`) memory.

When a system contains multiple GPU devices, specific GPU devices can be identified by including their ordinal index number.
For example, to reference the second GPU in a system `"cuda:1"` can be used.

By default, when `"cuda"` is provided, it is assumed to be `"cuda:0"` or the first GPU enumerated by the system.


## Properties

### `id`

Gets the identity, or ordinal, of the device.

When the device is the [`HOST`](device_kind.md#host), this value is always `0`.

When the device is a [`GPU`](device_kind.md#cuda), this value identifies a specific GPU.

### `kind`

Gets the [`DeviceKind`](device_kind.md) of device the instance references.
