# dynamo.connect.RdmaMetadata

A Pydantic type intended to provide JSON serialized RDMA metadata about a [`ReadableOperation`](readable_operation.md) or [`WritableOperation`](writable_operation.md) object.
RDMA metadata contains detailed information about a worker process and how to access memory descriptors registered with it.
This data is required to perform data transfers using the NIXL based RDMA subsystem.

> [!Warning]
> RDMA metadata contains a worker's address as well as security keys to access specific registered memory descriptors.
> This data provides direct memory access between workers, and should be considered sensitive and therefore handled accordingly.

Use the respective class's `.metadata()` method to generate an `RdmaMetadata` object for an operation.

> [!Tip]
> Classes using `RdmaMetadata` objects must be paired correctly.
> [`ReadableOperation`](readable_operation.md) with [`ReadOperation`](read_operation.md), and
> [`WritableOperation`](write_operation.md) with [`WriteOperation`](write_operation.md).
> Incorrect pairing will result in an error being raised.
